## Data types

### Bools

Booleans need to include <stdbool.h> in order to work.

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
int main() {
    bool sheLovesMe = false;
    return 1;
}
```

### Chars

Since C is not object-oriented, it doesn't have a string type, so we need to use a char array.

```c
int main {
    char name[] = "CÃ©sar"
}
```
